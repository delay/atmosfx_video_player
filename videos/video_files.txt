I was using the Unliving Portrait Collection from Atmosfx. 
This is the link.

I merged the ones in family feud singles directory TV/Wall no frame. 
There are three different scenes so I used imovie to merge each of 
the daughter scenes into one video and then did the same for the gent 
and the madam.  It then just plays an infinite loop of the three videos, 
one video per monitor. I did not include the actual videos.  
They are available for purchase from atmosFx.  I am not affiliated with 
them I just wanted a way to easily play the videos on 3 separate monitors 
so I could make three framed monitors and keep all the videos in sync.  
You need a computer that can support output to three separate monitors.
